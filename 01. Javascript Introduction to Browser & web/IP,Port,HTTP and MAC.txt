1. IP Address (Internet Protocol Address):
   - An IP address is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network 
   that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.
   - IP addresses serve two main purposes: host or network interface identification and location addressing.
   - There are two versions of IP addresses in use today: IPv4 (32-bit address) and IPv6 (128-bit address), with IPv6 designed to address the limitations of IPv4, such as address exhaustion.

2. Port:
   - Ports are virtual endpoints used for communication between different processes or services on a computer network.
   - In the context of TCP/IP networking, ports are identified by a 16-bit unsigned integer, ranging from 0 to 65535.
   - Ports help multiplex multiple network communications onto a single IP address.

3. HTTP Methods:
   - HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web.
   - HTTP defines a set of request methods (also known as HTTP verbs) that indicate the desired action to be performed on a given resource.
   - Common HTTP methods include:
     - GET: Requests data from a specified resource.
     - POST: Submits data to be processed to a specified resource.
     - PUT: Updates a specified resource with the provided data.
     - DELETE: Deletes the specified resource.
     - PATCH: Applies partial modifications to a resource.
     - HEAD: Requests the headers of a resource without requesting the body content.

4. MAC Address (Media Access Control Address):
   - A MAC address is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for communications at the data link layer of a network segment.
   - MAC addresses are typically assigned by the manufacturer of network interface hardware and are used for identifying devices within a local network.
   - MAC addresses are usually represented as six groups of two hexadecimal digits separated by colons or hyphens.
